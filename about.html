      <p><strong>Hi I'm Jun Lam</strong> Ever wondered what it would be like to drop everything you know and the security of your
        comfortable life and take off into the unknown? That’s what I did 2 years ago, leaving my law
        practise (something I had been doing for 17 years), my family and friends in Australia and going to
        live in the UK to start a whole new business, and life.

        If you are an entrepreneur or an investor, you might relate. Starting a business or investing into a
        new project may not be as drastic as upping your roots, but it is similar as it is new and exciting and
        full of potential. It isn’t the easiest route though is it, or we’d all be doing it? The 3 ‘C’ hurdles in any
        new venture or project? Capital, Cashflow, Clients. Investors have their own set of hurdles too –
        Capital growth and Cashflow being the two big ones.
